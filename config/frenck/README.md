# Frenck's Marling Configuration

This is my personal config of the Community firmware for the Creality CR-6 SE
3D printer.

My Creality CR-6 SE has modifications, so you cannot use this firmware on
a factory state printer. I've swapped the following parts:

- Mainboard: [BigTreeTech BTT SKR-CR6 v1.0](https://www.bigtree-tech.com/products/btt-skr-cr6-v1-0.html)
- Bowden tube: Capricorn XS Ultra-Low Friction PTFE

This repository contains my personal settings and preferences, but is also used
to contribute back upstream if needed.

Current changes in here for my personal taste:

- Custom version/names; just looks cool on the display ;)
- Set serial baudrate to 250000
- Enable advanced OK + increase buffers

Originally I used a [BigTreeTech BTT TFT70 V3.0](https://www.biqu.equipment/products/btt-tft43-v3-0-tft50-v3-0-tft70-v3-0-display-touch-screen-two-working-modes),
however, with the progress made on the stock display by the community,
I've decided to swap back.

Most of my previous tweaks are no longer needed, as the community firmware
has most of those now baked in :)

Use at your own risk.
